# Project Unity: Addressables Project

Welcome to my Unity repository, where I share my project developed as part of the official Unity course. This project is a study of Addressables and CDN.

## Project description

### Addressables Project Challenges
The gameplay is simple: you control Dino on his quest to discover all the dungeons in the world. Tap anywhere on the map and it will move to that location. Find the chest, get the key and open the door to move to the next level.

The main test includes including the hats in the addressables system and instantiating them on the character, but it contains other topics such as CDN and Profiles.
